# Darwin AI

> Tokenizing preserved lands, carbon credits, renewable energy and natural commodities through SOL blockchain 

**Darwin AI** is an artificial intelligence agent designed to lead sustainable evolution by integrating the power of blockchain technology with environmental preservation. Our goal is to make natural assets more accessible, transparent, and valued, bridging the gap between the real and digital worlds.

## Mission

To promote sustainability and environmental preservation through the tokenization of:

- Preserved lands
- Carbon credits
- Renewable energy
- Commodities such as water and sustainable wood

Ensuring a more inclusive economy connected to nature.

## Features

- **Tokenization of Natural Assets**: Transform physical assets into digital tokens to facilitate transactions and investments.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track the performance and environmental impact of tokenized assets.
- **Transparency and Security**: Utilize blockchain technology to ensure data integrity and traceability.

## Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Primary programming language for application development.
- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/): Blockchain platform used for creating and managing tokens.
- [Smart Contracts](https://soliditylang.org/): Developed in Solidity to automate processes.
- [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/): Distributed file system for decentralized data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) or another blockchain simulator for local testing
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to interact with the decentralized application
